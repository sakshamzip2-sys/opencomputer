"""Plugin-authored slash commands.

A plugin can expose in-chat slash commands (e.g. ``/plan``, ``/diff``)
by registering a SlashCommand subclass via
``PluginAPI.register_slash_command``. The host dispatches any message
whose first token starts with ``/`` to the matching command.

Formalization of the Phase-6f duck-typed contract. Legacy duck-typed
commands (any object with ``name``, ``description``, ``execute``) are
still accepted by the dispatcher for backwards compat.

``execute`` is **async** because it can touch filesystem state
(checkpoints, rewind), call back into the agent, and integrates with
the already-async agent loop. Legacy synchronous-returning commands
that return a plain string are also accepted — the dispatcher wraps
their return value in a ``SlashCommandResult`` for callers.

    #: ``"skill"`` — handler was the slash-skill fallback that loaded a
    #: SKILL.md body. The agent loop wraps the result as a synthetic
    #: ``Skill`` ``tool_use`` + ``tool_result`` pair so the model sees the
    #: skill content as authoritative tool output (Claude-Code parity).
