"""
RuntimeContext — per-turn flags passed through the agent loop.

The CLI / caller builds this once per invocation. The agent loop passes it
to InjectionProviders (so they can decide whether to fire) and to Hooks
(so they can decide whether to block). `delegate` propagates it to
subagents, so modes like `--plan` apply to the whole subagent tree.

Frozen dataclass — safe to share across tasks / threads.

``RequestContext`` (Task I.9) is the adjacent per-REQUEST scope —
populated by the gateway around each inbound channel message so plugins
can query the request identity (auth gating, rate limiting, activation
context queries). CLI + direct AgentLoop calls leave it None.
